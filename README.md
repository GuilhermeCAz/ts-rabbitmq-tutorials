This project is a hands-on exploration of RabbitMQ using TypeScript. It follows the JavaScript tutorials provided by RabbitMQ's official documentation to demonstrate basic messaging patterns and concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main applications under the `apps` directory:

- [**queues**](apps/queues): Contains implementations for RabbitMQ messaging using queues.
- **streams**: Placeholder for potential future implementations using RabbitMQ streams.

Each tutorial or concept is structured in its own directory under `queues/src`, following a modular approach for easy understanding and experimentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- RabbitMQ server running locally or accessible via network.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeCAz/ts-rabbitmq-tutorials
   cd ts-rabbitmq-tutorials
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Tutorials

Each tutorial is in a separate folder under the `queues/src` or `streams/src` directory. To run a tutorial, simply follow the instructions in the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file of the tutorial.
